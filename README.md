# Circle Monorepo

This repository is an experiment with Lerna and Circle CI.

The goal is to build a bare bones project that achieves the following:

- [ ] Allow developers to work on and upgrade web app, components, and types simultaneously
- [ ] Allow versioning to happen automatically via changesets
- [ ] Publish packages to package manager
- [ ] Block package upgrades via testing and linting requirements
- [ ] Publish global changelog that describes changes for each project
